        <h1>Support and FAQs</h1>
        <h2>App Usage</h2>
        <h3>1. Why is there no data on the Records page?</h3>
        <p>The data on the "Records" page comes from your assessment results. Please go to the "Assessment" function and complete at least one full assessment test, and the related graphical data will automatically appear on the Records page.</p>
        <h3>2. Why are there so few audio files available for training?</h3>
        <p>Thank you for your feedback! The app is currently in a phase of rapid development and iteration. We plan to add more diverse audio sources in future versions and gradually introduce the ability for users to import custom audio files. Stay tuned!</p>
        <h2>Hearing and Devices</h2>
        <h3>1. Why can’t I hear ultra-low frequency sounds?</h3>
        <p>Ultra-low frequencies (typically below 60Hz) have high requirements for playback devices. Regular phone speakers or consumer-grade earphones may not be able to reproduce such low frequencies. For the best training experience, we strongly recommend using high-quality studio headphones or external audio equipment.</p>
        <h3>2. Why can’t I hear high-frequency sounds?</h3>
        <p>This is usually a normal physiological phenomenon. The human hearing range naturally declines with age, particularly in the high-frequency range. Additionally, long-term noise exposure, genetic factors, and the health of hair cells in the cochlea can affect the highest frequencies you can hear.</p>
        <h2>Feature Explanation</h2>
        <h3>1. How can I learn about the detailed explanations of "frequency," "dynamics," and parameters (threshold, compression ratio, etc.)?</h3>
        <p>We provide detailed explanations for each core feature. In the app, you’ll find an "Info" button (<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">ⓘ</span>) in the top-right corner of each feature page. Click it to view a complete introduction and operation guide for that feature.</p>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <h3>1. How can I contact the developer if I have other questions or suggestions?</h3>
