        <h1>Support & FAQ</h1>
        <h2>App Usage</h2>
        <h3>1. Why is there no data in the Records page?</h3>
        <p>The data on the "Records" page comes from your assessment results. Please go to the "Assessment" feature first and complete at least one full assessment test, then the relevant graphical data will automatically appear on the Records page.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Why are there so few audio files available for training?</h3>
        <p>Thank you for your suggestion! The app is currently in a phase of rapid feature development and iteration. We plan to add more diverse audio sources in future versions and gradually introduce the ability for users to import custom audio files. Please stay tuned.</p>
        <h2>Hearing & Equipment</h2>
        <h3>1. Why can't I hear Ultra Low frequency sounds?</h3>
        <p>Ultra-low frequencies (typically below 60Hz) require high-quality playback equipment. Regular smartphone speakers or consumer-grade headphones may not be able to reproduce such low frequencies. For the best training experience, we strongly recommend using high-quality studio monitor headphones or external audio equipment.</p>
        <h3>2. Why can't I hear High frequency sounds?</h3>
        <p>This is usually a normal physiological phenomenon. Human hearing range naturally deteriorates with age, particularly in the high-frequency range. Additionally, prolonged noise exposure, genetic factors, and the health of hair cells in the cochlea all affect the highest frequencies you can hear.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Feature Explanations</h2>
        <h3>1. How can I learn more about "Frequency," "Dynamics," and various parameters (threshold, compression ratio, etc.)?</h3>
        <p>We provide detailed explanations for each core feature. In the upper right corner of each feature page within the app, you'll find an "Info" button (<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">â“˜</span>). Click on it to view comprehensive introductions and operation guides for that specific feature.</p>
